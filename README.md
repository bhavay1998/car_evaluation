# Correspondence Analysis: Car Evaluation Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform correspondence analysis to identify the relationship between categories of each descriptive variable with the categories of carâ€™s evaluation level. Car Evaluation Dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository is used. The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates car acceptability *(evaluation level)* to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

All variables in the dataset are categorical. There are 1728 instances with no missing values for any of the variables.

## Categories of the variables used 
  Categories of Car Evaluation *(Target variable in the original study)*:** 
  unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good <br><br>

  Categories of input attributes *(Feature variables in the original study)*:**
  buying price: vhigh, high, med, low<br>
  price of the maintenance: vhigh, high, med, low<br>
  number of doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more<br>
  capacity in terms of persons to carry: 2, 4, more<br>
  the size of luggage boot: small, med, big<br>
  estimated safety of the car: low, med, high
